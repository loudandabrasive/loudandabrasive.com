  title: Giant Squid
  date: 2013-06-15
  medium: cardboard
  description: "This 'Jules Vernian' giant is made from full-width corrugated 12-pack boxes. Specifically Shiner Ruby Redbird (a summer favorite) and the Boulevard brewing mix-12, which also contains some choice brews. Boulevard's boxes are also great for colorful storage. One of my largest pieces, and the first to include 'exposed' corrugation as an intentional detail."

  title: Blue Jay
  date: 2014-02-18
  medium: cardboard
  description: "A blue jay made from generic white cardboard, black matte board, and St. Arnold's Spring Bock box. At the time, the spring bock featured a lovely photo of bluebonnets. They've since changed all their labels to stylized illustrations, which are still very nice."

  title: El Prototipo
  date: 2014-07-12
  medium: cardboard
  description: "Proof of concept (a prototype, if you will) of a cardboard action figure -type sculpture. Some simple muscle-shapes made pose-able by florists' wire. This pattern was followed again much later and more fully-decorated to make 'El Roble Poderoso.'"

  title: El Roble Poderoso
  date: 2017-02-11
  medium: cardboard
  description: "Luchador figure similar in design to 'El Prototipo' but decorated with the leafy green box art from Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA to best represent 'The Mighty Oak.' Unlike El Prototipo, El Roble Poderoso has trouble standing on his own two feet, so he has a nice gynmists's stand to lean on. This was entered into an art contest for City of Austin employees and their families. It did not win."

  title: Crested Bunting
  date: 2019-07-08
  medium: cardboard
  description: "This Himalayan bird was made from a box of Shiner Black lager and a bag from Cavendar's Boot city. A bit more detail in this one than any of the birds before it, and the first plumage-heavy crest, too. This was made for a charity auction at work."

  title: "Lattice-Tailed Trogon"
  date: 2020-12-27
  medium: cardboard
  description: "The lattice-tailed trogon is a tropical bird native to Costa Rica and Panama, made as a gift celebrating a trip to the former. Another more detailed work, and first I've done 'perched' instead of free standing - I like it, how about you? This was made from plain corrugated cardboard, Lone Star, Southern Tier 2xOne, and St. Arnold White Noise boxes."
