  title: Giant Squid
  date: 2013-06-15
  medium: cardboard
  description: "This 'Jules Vernian' giant is made from full-width corrugated 12-pack boxes. Specifically Shiner Ruby Redbird (a summer favorite) and the Boulevard brewing mix-12, which also contains some choice brews. Boulevard's boxes are also great for colorful storage. One of my largest pieces, and the first to include 'exposed' corrugation as an intentional detail."

  title: Blue Jay
  date: 2014-02-18
  medium: cardboard
  description: "A blue jay made from generic white cardboard, black matte board, and St. Arnold's Spring Bock box. At the time, the spring bock featured a lovely photo of bluebonnets. They've since changed all their labels to stylized illustrations, which are still very nice."

  title: El Prototipo
  date: 2014-07-12
  medium: cardboard
  description: "Proof of concept (a prototype, if you will) of a cardboard action figure -type sculpture. Some simple muscle-shapes made pose-able by florists' wire. This pattern was followed again much later and more fully-decorated to make 'El Roble Poderoso.'"

  title: El Roble Poderoso
  date: 2017-02-11
  medium: cardboard
  description: "Luchador figure similar in design to 'El Prototipo' but decorated with the leafy green box art from Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA to best represent 'The Mighty Oak.' Unlike El Prototipo, El Roble Poderoso has trouble standing on his own two feet, so he has a nice gynmists's stand to lean on. This was entered into an art contest for City of Austin employees and their families. It did not win."
