## Our Story

In 2008, our founder and program director Patrick McVeety-Mill was at a loss for what to choose for his online moniker. It had to be unique, provacative, and evocative of himself. The story goes:

> One day while lamenting the perdicament on the floor of a friend's dorm, an acquaintance stopped by, and offered an (ill-meant) insight: "You're just so loud and abrasive." "THAT'S IT! Was the resounding reply, and the visitor left in a huff.

Today, Patrick is not so abrasive (you can judge his volume yourself) but the spirit of the phrase lives on in his works. Loud & Abrasive is a home for the artistic, physical, digital, spiritual, and occasionally stupid endeavors he shares with the world.
