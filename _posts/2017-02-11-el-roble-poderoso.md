title: "El Roble Poderoso"
date: 2017-02-11
category: Sculpture
medium: cardboard
description: "Luchador figure similar in design to 'El Prototipo' but decorated with the leafy green box art from Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA to best represent 'The Mighty Oak.' Unlike El Prototipo, El Roble Poderoso has trouble standing on his own two feet, so he has a nice gynmists's stand to lean on. This was entered into an art contest for City of Austin employees and their families. It did not win."
