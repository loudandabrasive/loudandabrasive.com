        <p>
            Thanks for your patience while we get the site put together.
            There's not much here now, so your best bet is to follow the
            social media profiles linked above and stayed tuned for updates.

        <h3>Where is Patrick ?!?</h3>

        <p>If you're here looking for
            <a href="https://pmcvtm.com" target="_blank">Patrick McVeety-Mill</a>'s
            blog, it has moved to <a href="https://blog.pmcvtm.com">blog.pmcvtm.com</a>.
            Most of the URLs should be the same, so try that.
        </p>
